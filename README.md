# control_module

Robot Control Module under construction. The code was initially on beaglebone
black and now runs on raspberry pi 2 with the following hardware:

atmega24u4 encoder reader on i2c
motor controller from Adafruit on i2c
10 DOH sensor from Adafruit on i2c

The code is currently in POC/testing state. Incorporating a stereo
camera module to be used in mapping/localization.
